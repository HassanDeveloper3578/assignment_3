        <h6>Assalam-o-Alaikum</h6>
        <br>
        <h6>Who is it that would loan Allah goodly loan so He may multiply it for him many times over?(Surat Baqara,
            Verse 245)
        </h6><br>
        <h6>It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give
            Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth.Allah speakes about qarz
            because it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds.
            Allah conveys his message to the muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend
            their wealth in a certain way.He say, Oh children of Adam!Trust me with your wealth.If you do so, no fire,
            flood or thieves will be able to rob you off your money.Instead,you will be endowed with your wealth when
            you most need it. He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the
            negligence of the rich, who should not be stingy spending their money on those worse off than
            themselves.Allah will not only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them
            accordingly.On the Day Of Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy.The
            will comnplain to Allah and say that all those menon whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth
            showed negligence in its proper use; they were busy spending on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who
            needed it.Allah will reply to this and says;<q>I swear on my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to
                me and pushthem further away.</q>
        </h6><br>
        <h6>Alhamdollilah,Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by sending those people our way who
            follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith give zakat,fidyad fitrah,khairat and other donations to
            help us help those in need.The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only spread this
            message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the needy till the
            Day of Judgment.</h6>
